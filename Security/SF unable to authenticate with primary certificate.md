# Service Fabric unable to authenticate with primary certificate

## **Symptom**
- After adding a new secondary certificate you are now unable to authenticate with the original Primary certificate
    - This is regardless if the older certificate is in the primary or secondary cert position
    - Event logs may show FABRIC_E_SERVER_AUTHENTICATION_FAILED: 0x80092012

## **Cause**
- By design
- Starting with Service fabric 5.7 a design change was made to help simplify the certificate rollover process.  This changed the default behavior to automatically use the certificate with the furthest expiration (in the future) for authentication.

## **Resolution**
- Use the certificate with furthest expiration date for authentication
- Or you can revert to the old algorithm by using following command, which will cause the cluster to only use the primary certificate.  To use the newly added certificate you will need to manually swap the secondary cert and primary cert.

```PowerShell
Set-AzureRmServiceFabricSetting -ResourceGroupName rgname -Name clustername -Section "Security" -Parameter "UseSecondaryIfNewer" -Value "false"
```
