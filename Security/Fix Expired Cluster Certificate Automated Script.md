# [UPDATE 10/05/2019] 
Service Fabric clusters running 6.5 CU3 or later (version 6.5.658.9590 or higher), if the cluster is secured with a self-signed certificate declared by thumbprint you can now optionally follow this much simpler process.  For CA issued certificates follow the steps outlined below.  

* [Fix Expired Cluster Certificate](../Security/How%20to%20recover%20from%20an%20Expired%20Cluster%20Certificate.md)


## [Symptom] 
   * Cluster will show 'Upgrade Service not reachable' warning message
   * Unable to see the SF Nodes in the Portal or SFX
   * Error message related to Certificate in  '%SystemRoot%\System32\Winevt\Logs\Microsoft-ServiceFabric%4Admin.evtx'  event log from 'transport' resource

## [Verify Certificate Expired Status on Node]
   * [RDP](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-remote-connect-to-azure-cluster-node) to any node
        * Open the Certificate Manager for 'Local Computer' (certlm.msc) and check below details
        * Make sure certificate is ACL'd to network service
        * Verify the Certificate Expiry, if it is expired, follow below steps

## [Fix Expired Cert steps]

1. Create new certificate to replace the expired certificate (choose one)

  > a. Create with any reputable CA  
  > b. Generate self-signed certs using Azure Portal -> Key Vault.  
  > c. Create and upload using PowerShell - [CreateKeyVaultAndCertificateForServiceFabric.ps1](../Scripts/CreateKeyVaultAndCertificateForServiceFabric.ps1)

2. Deploy new cert to all nodes in VMSS, go to <https://resources.azure.com>, navigate to the virtual machine scale set configured for the cluster:

```
    subscriptions
    └───%subscription name%
        └───resourceGroups
            └───%resource group name%
                └───providers
                    └───Microsoft.Compute
                        └───virtualMachineScaleSets
                            └───%virtual machine scale set name%
```

![Edit](../media/resourcemgr2.png)

4. Modify **"virtualMachineProfile / osProfile / secrets"**, to add (deploy) the new certificate to each of the nodes in the nodetype. Choose one of the options below:

> a. If the new certificate is in the **same Key Vault** as the Primary, add **"certificateUrl"** and **"certificateStore"** to existing array of **"vaultCertificates"** as shown below:

```json
  "virtualMachineProfile": {
    "osProfile": {
    …
      "secrets": [
        {
          "sourceVault": {
            "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/sampleVaultGroup/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/samplevault"
        },
        "vaultCertificates": [
          {
            "certificateUrl": "https://samplevault.vault.azure.net/secrets/clustercert001/d5eeaf025c7d435f81e7420393b442a9",
            "certificateStore": "My"
          },
          {
            "certificateUrl": "https://samplevault.vault.azure.net/secrets/clustercert002/77ff7688258a41f7b0afdd890eb4aa8c",
            "certificateStore": "My"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
```

> b. If the new certificate is in a **different Key Vault** as the Primary, add an additional secret to the array of **"secrets"** with **"sourceVault"** and **"vaultCertificates"** configuration as shown below:

```json
  "virtualMachineProfile": {
    "osProfile": {
    …
    "secrets": [
      {
        "sourceVault": {
          "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/sampleVaultGroup/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/samplevault"
        },
        "vaultCertificates": [
          {
            "certificateUrl": "https://samplevault.vault.azure.net/secrets/clustercert001/d5eeaf025c7d435f81e7420393b442a9",
            "certificateStore": "My"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "sourceVault": {
          "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/sampleVaultGroup/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/samplevault2"
        },
        "vaultCertificates": [
          {
            "certificateUrl": "https://samplevault2.vault.azure.net/secrets/clustercert002/77ff7688258a41f7b0afdd890eb4aa8c",
            "certificateStore": "My"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
```

5. At top of page, click PUT.

![Click PUT](../media/resourcemgr7.png)

6. **Wait** for the virtual machine scale set Updating the secondary certificate to complete. At the top of page, click GET to check status. Verify "provisioningState" shows "Succeeded". If "provisioningState" equals "Updating", continue to periodically click GET at top of page to requery scale set.  If the cluster is configured with Silver or higher Durability it's possible a repair task may block this operation.  If the status does not move into a "Succeeded" state in a timely manner please contact Support for assistance to confirm and unblock.

7. [RDP](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-remote-connect-to-azure-cluster-node) into node 0 for each NodeType in the cluster

    * if a cluster has a single nodetype they only need to RDP into one of the nodes

    * If a cluster has multiple nodetypes they need to RDP into one node on each nodetype
 
8. For each nodetype you are mitigating, open PowerShell ISE (verify it is running as Administrator)
    * Download [FixExpiredCert.ps1](../Scripts/FixExpiredCert.ps1)

    * Open PowerShell ISE and edit Parameter values as necessary ($oldThumbprint, $newThumbprint, $nodeIpArray)

        Note: $nodeIpArray should list IP addresses for all nodes in the specific vnet for the nodetype you are working on

```PowerShell
        Param(
            [Parameter(Mandatory=$false)]
            [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
            [string] $clusterDataRootPath="D:\SvcFab",

            [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
            [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
    --->    [string]$oldThumbprint="replace with expired thumbprint",

            [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
            [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
    --->    [string]$newThumbprint="replace with new thumbprint",

            [Parameter(Mandatory=$false)]
            [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
            [string]$certStoreLocation='Cert:\LocalMachine\My\',

            [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
            [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
    --->    [string[]]$nodeIpArray=@("10.0.0.4","10.0.0.5","10.0.0.6" )
        )
```

9. RDP to each node in the node type, and run the FixExpiredCert.ps1 script with the following cmd line

```
  .\FixExpiredCert.ps1 
  
  or
  
  .\FixExpiredCert.ps1 -localOnly
```

   * If you do not specify -localOnly it will prompt for the RDP credentials and then attempt to remotely execute all the necessary mitigation steps for each node listed in the nodeIpArray using Remote PowerShell, however this remote PS capability is often disabled on nodes by default and will result in HTTP 502 error and a PSRemotingTransportException.  If you see this it means you will need to RDP into each node and run the script using the -localOnly switch as shown above  

        Note: If there are any errors or issues when running the script you can attempt to fix\correct these and just rerun the script, changes made by the script are idempotent.  In some cases if there are many nodes and you know the mitigation was already successful on some nodes before the script failed then you can remove those from the nodeIpArray to speed things up, but there is no harm if the mitigation is run multiple times on the same node.
 
10. After step 9 services should be restarting and when ready you should able to reconnect to the cluster over SFX and PowerShell from your development computer.  *(Make sure you have installed the new Cert to `CurrentUser\My`)*

```PowerShell
        $ClusterName= "clustername.cluster_region.cloudapp.azure.com:19000"
        $Certthumprint = "{replace_with_ClusterThumprint}"

        Connect-ServiceFabricCluster -ConnectionEndpoint $ClusterName -KeepAliveIntervalInSec 10 `
            -X509Credential `
            -ServerCertThumbprint $Certthumprint  `
            -FindType FindByThumbprint `
            -FindValue $Certthumprint `
            -StoreLocation CurrentUser `
            -StoreName My
```

**Note 1**: Please give the cluster 5-10 minutes to reconfigure.  Generally speaking you will see Fabric.exe startup in the Task Manager and a few minutes later FabricGateway.exe will start when the nodes have finished reconfiguration.  At this point the cluster should be running using the new certificate and SFX endpoint and PowerShell endpoints should be accessible.

11. The cluster will not display Nodes/applications/or reflect the new Thumbprint yet because the Service Fabric Resource Provider (SFRP) record for this cluster has not be updated with the new thumbprint. **To correct this Contact Azure support to create a support ticket to request the final update to the SFRP record.**

12. The last step will be to update the cluster ARM template to reflect the location of the new Cert / Keyvault

    * Go to https://resources.azure.com --> Resource Group --> providers --> Microsoft.Compute --> vmss


Ensure the correct KeyVault for the new cert is listed, update the "sourceVault" and "certificateUrl" properties

```json
            "secrets": [
            {
                "sourceVault": {
                "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourcegroups/xxxxxx/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/xxxxxxxx"
                },
                "vaultCertificates": [
                {
                    "certificateUrl": "https://xxxxxx.vault.azure.net/secrets/xxxxxx/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
                    "certificateStore": "My"
                }
                ]
            }
```

Update the "thumbprint" property with the new certificate thumbprint

```json
            "extensionProfile": {
                "extensions": [
                {
                    "properties": {
                    "autoUpgradeMinorVersion": true,
                    "settings": {
                        "clusterEndpoint": "https://xxxxx.servicefabric.azure.com/runtime/clusters/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
                        "nodeTypeRef": "sys",
                        "dataPath": "D:\\\\SvcFab",
                        "durabilityLevel": "Bronze",
                        "enableParallelJobs": true,
                        "nicPrefixOverride": "10.0.0.0/24",
                        "certificate": {
                        "thumbprint": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
                        "x509StoreName": "My"
                        }
```
