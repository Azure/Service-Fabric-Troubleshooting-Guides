# How to configure Azure Devops for Service Fabric ARM template deployments

This guide documents the process to configure Azure Devops (ADO) for Service Fabric ARM template deployments. This can be used for both cluster and application deployments. This is valid for both unmanaged and managed clusters. 

For managed clusters deployments not using ARM templates, see [How to configure Azure Devops for Service Fabric Managed Cluster](../How%20to%20configure%20Azure%20Devops%20for%20Service%20Fabric%20managed%20cluster.md).

For unmanaged clusters deployments not using ARM templates, see [How to configure Azure Devops for Service Fabric Cluster](../How%20to%20configure%20Azure%20Devops%20for%20Service%20Fabric%20cluster.md).
