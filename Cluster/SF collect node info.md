# Collecting Service Fabric Windows node diagnostics data

When working with Microsoft support on a Service Fabric Windows cluster issue, it may be necessary to capture additional diagnostics information from one or more nodes in the cluster. 

## Default diagnostic information script will collect:
**NOTE: All of these options disabled using switch arguments when running script.**
- Windows Event Logs - System, Application, Firewall, Http, Service Fabric
- Operating System information
    - Drive configuration
    - Directory list of 'MachineKeys' folder
    - Process exceptions / dumps list
    - Installed Applications
    - Installed Windows Features
    - .Net Registry export
    - Policies Registry export
    - Schannel Registry export
    - Processes
    - Services
    - Drivers
    - Hotfixes
- Network information
    - Network port tests
    - External connection test
    - DNS name resolution
    - NSLookup
    - HTTPERR log
    - Firewall Rules
    - Firewall Configuration
    - Network connections
    - Netsh SSL information
    - IP Configuration
    - WinRM settings
- Service Fabric information
    - Service Fabric registry exort
    - Directory list of fabric data root
    - Directory list of fabric root
    - Copy of Service Fabric configuration (.xml) files
    - List of Seed nodes
    - SFRP network connectivity check with installed certificate
    - REST queries to local FabricGateway for Cluster / Node / App / and Service events

## Optional diagnostic information script can collect:
- Certificate information store list
- Performance Monitor counter collection for basic performance
- Network trace

# Requirements
- Windows 2012 / Windows  2016 Service Fabric cluster
- Script files:
    - [sf-collect-node-info.ps1](../Scripts/sf-collect-node-info.ps1)
    - [event-log-manager.ps1](http://aka.ms/event-log-manager.ps1)  
        NOTE: event-log-manager.ps1 is used to process Windows Event logs and will be downloaded automatically if there is network connectivity.

# Setup
There are multiple ways to run this script to collect information.
1. RDP and run script locally on each node(s).
2. Assuming proper connectivity and authentication, from administrator machine, run script remotely for each node(s).
3. Assuming proper connectivity and authentication, RDP into a node and run script remotely for each node(s).

# Instructions
1. Copy the script files specified above to location where script will be executed. If network connectivity exists on machine where script will be executed, the following command can be used to download:
```powershell
    (new-object net.webclient).downloadfile("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Service-Fabric-Troubleshooting-Guides/master/S
    cripts/sf-collect-node-info.ps1","c:\sf-collect-node-info.ps1");
```
2. Preferably, open Administrator Powershell prompt.  
    **NOTE: A non-Administrator powershell prompt can be used if needed but not all data will be collected.**
3. To execute with default configuration:
```powershell
    c:\sf-collect-node-info.ps1
```
4. After script has executed, instructions will be displayed showing location of zip file containing all of the diagnostics.
5. Upload diagnostics zip file to case workspace.
6. For additional information about different arguments and switches, see 'Help' information below or from command prompt type:
```powershell
    help c:\sf-collect-node-info.ps1 -full
```

DESCRIPTION
    To enable script execution, you may need to Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Force
    script will collect event logs, hotfixes, services, processes, drive, firewall, and other OS information

    Requirements:
        - administrator powershell prompt
        - administrative access to machine
        - remote network ports:
            - smb 445
            - rpc endpoint mapper 135
            - rpc ephemeral ports
            - to test access from source machine to remote machine: dir \\%remote machine%\admin$
        - winrm
            - depending on configuration / security, it may be necessary to modify trustedhosts on
            source machine for management of remote machines
            - to query: winrm get winrm/config
            - to enable sending credentials to remote machines: winrm set winrm/config/client '@{TrustedHosts="*"}'
            - to disable sending credentials to remote machines: winrm set winrm/config/client '@{TrustedHosts=""}'
        - firewall
            - if firewall is preventing connectivity the following can be run to disable
            - Set-NetFirewallProfile -Profile Domain,Public,Private -Enabled False
