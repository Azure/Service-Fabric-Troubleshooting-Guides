# Azure Cloud Services Migration Decision Matrix

This document provides a decision matrix to help evaluate migration options for an Azure solution currently built on Cloud Services. The matrix compares various Azure platform technologies to help guide your re-architecting decisions.

## Decision Matrix

| **Criteria / Option**          | **Service Fabric**                                        | **Azure Functions**                                           | **Azure Web Apps (App Service)**                              | **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**                         | **Azure Virtual Machines**                                  |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Migration Complexity**       | Moderate-to-high. Requires rearchitecting roles to stateful/stateless services. Often a learning curve for state management and orchestration. | Low-to-moderate. Best suited for event-driven, lightweight tasks. Significant rework if the app isn’t designed for serverless. | Low-to-moderate. Often similar to current web role structure. Minimal rework required. | High. Containerizing your app requires a deep understanding of microservices and orchestration. | High. Lift-and-shift may be simpler, but it doesn’t leverage cloud-native benefits. |
| **Scalability & Performance**  | High. Designed for complex microservices and can scale stateful/stateless workloads effectively. | High. Automatic scaling based on events, but can be subject to cold starts. | Moderate-to-high. Built-in scaling features, but may need manual configuration for advanced scenarios. | Very high. Container orchestration allows fine-grained scaling and resilience. | Limited. Scalability depends on manual scaling and VM size/configuration. |
| **Control & Customization**    | High. Full control over service orchestration and state management. | Limited. Managed service with constrained runtime environment and execution limits. | Moderate. Managed platform with some configuration options; less control over underlying infrastructure. | High. Maximum control over container orchestration and runtime environment. | Very high. Complete control over the OS, middleware, and runtime. |
| **Operational Overhead**       | Moderate. Requires management of cluster health, upgrades, and stateful services. | Low. Managed service abstracts infrastructure, reducing operational overhead. | Low-to-moderate. Microsoft manages the platform, though some app-specific issues remain. | High. Requires in-depth operational expertise (monitoring, updates, networking, etc.). | High. Full responsibility for maintenance, patching, and security. |
| **Ecosystem Integration**      | Strong. Integrates well with Azure’s service-oriented ecosystem, but may require additional configuration. | Strong. Natively integrated with Azure’s event grid, logic apps, and other serverless services. | Strong. First-class integration with CI/CD, monitoring, and other Azure services. | Strong. Works well with modern DevOps tools, though integration complexity increases with microservices. | Variable. While integration is possible, it often requires more custom development. |
| **Use Case Suitability**       | Ideal for applications needing fine-grained control over microservices, including stateful services. | Best for event-driven workloads, batch processing, and where latency is acceptable. | Well-suited for web apps and APIs with a standard request/response model. | Excellent for microservices and containerized workloads that require high availability and scalability. | Good for legacy applications that require minimal changes, but less cloud-optimized. |

## Additional Considerations

- **Legacy vs. Re-architected:**  
  If you’re looking to modernize your architecture beyond a lift-and-shift, then options like Service Fabric, AKS, or even a serverless approach with Functions might provide better long-term benefits despite higher initial re-architecting costs.

- **Skill Set and Team Expertise:**  
  Evaluate your team’s familiarity with microservices (Service Fabric, AKS) versus serverless or PaaS (Web Apps, Functions). Training and adoption curves could influence your decision.

- **Cost Implications:**  
  Managed services (Functions, Web Apps) may reduce operational costs compared to managing your own container clusters (AKS) or VMs, but the pricing models (consumption vs. reserved instances) can vary significantly.

- **Future-Proofing:**  
  Consider how each option aligns with long-term product strategy. For example, AKS and containerized architectures are gaining popularity for their portability and ease of integration with CI/CD pipelines.

- **Performance and Latency Requirements:**  
  Some workloads might benefit from the granular control offered by Service Fabric or AKS, while others might be well served by the ease-of-use and autoscaling features of Functions or Web Apps.

## Next Steps

1. **Assess Your Workloads:**  
   Identify which components of your solution are best suited for each architecture—consider both compute-bound and stateful components.

2. **Prototype Migration:**  
   Consider building a proof-of-concept for the top two or three options. This can help uncover unforeseen challenges and better estimate migration complexity.

3. **Cost-Benefit Analysis:**  
   Include not only migration effort and operational overhead but also long-term benefits such as ease of updates, resilience, and scalability.

4. **Stakeholder Review:**  
   Share the decision matrix with your team and other stakeholders for feedback and to align on priorities.
